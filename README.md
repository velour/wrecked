# Wrecked [working title]

_An island survival game_


You were out boating one day, and your ship sank.  After swimming for what seemed like days, you finally washed up on the shore of a deserted island.  You are hungry, you are thirsty, and the island is filled with danger; you must escape!  Luckily, some of your equipment survived--you can see the crates washing ashore.  You must scavenge what you can to signal an airplane for rescue before you die of exposure.


Don’t starve, don’t dehydrate, don’t get eaten--get off the island!
